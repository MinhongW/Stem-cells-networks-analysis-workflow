# Stem-cells-networks-analysis-workflow
This implementable workflow is used to analyse stem cells networks under different conditions based on R. 
It can calculate different network measures and present the results with plots.
It also generate parallel coordinates plot to which allow user to see the interesting relationships between different measures. 
And scatter plots of different relationships of measures can be generated.
